<h3>Detailed Description of Resolving Merge Conflicts</h3>
Two branches 
1.feature/add-content
2.feature/update-styling

change in Branch-1 -> added border with border:solid 10px black
change in Branch-2 -> added border at the same positiomn with border:solid 10px blue
I performed a git merge feature/update-styling when I am in feature/add-content branch
Since, There is a change at same place 
conflict occurs
Resolve the conflict in merge editor
keep the current changes or incoming changes or both changes
then confirm merge
merge conflict is resolved !!
